I've been meaning to tidy up my stock portfolio for a while. So I researched some stocks I found had the right mix in diversity, beta, consistent return and high growth potential on simplywall.st (Great website btw). 

The next question was how would I split my money between the stocks to get the right mix of annual growth + diversification + low-Beta (volatility with respect to the market).

I came up with this simple script to bootstrap the *optimal* stock portfolio based on my needs.
Note that the optimal I found is not necessarily the TRUE optimal but it should tend towards it as you increase the number of iterations of the project.

Hope you find this useful as well.
